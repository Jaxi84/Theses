This is one of my first projects based on bots and IoT
I made an IoT nightlight for my son.
I found Fab Lab Oulu's video from Youtube about [IoT workshop tutorial]([url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXnfpvCrU_I&t=282s)) and got an idea.
Code is strictly based on others work and I just adjusted it for serving my purposes
