My thesis for embedded systems @ OSAO made on late 2022.
First time using PHP and I also didn't have much experience with Python or JS.
Info tv is based on Google Service account as a non-human user and downloads pictures from shared GoogleDrive folder.
Python file is for downloading the media. Karuselli.php is simple carousel for rolling all the pictures from the folder. 
Menu.php is for wrapping the lunch menu from local lunch restaurant.
During the project, there was a shortage of components and the system could only be tested with one Raspberry Pi 4 SBC.
