My thesis for embedded systems @ OSAO made on late 2022.<br/>
Missing atleast Google drive api library!!<br/>
First time using PHP and I also didn't have much experience with Python or JS.<br/>
Info tv is based on Google Service account as a non-human user and downloads pictures from shared GoogleDrive folder.<br/>
Python file is for downloading the media. Karuselli.php is simple carousel for rolling all the pictures from the folder. <br/>
Menu.php is for wrapping the lunch menu from local lunch restaurant.<br/>
